# To Do List
- Create a roadmap to guide OrangeSlice development. A rough roadmap will likely be:
    1. Planning Phase: 
        - Make decisions regarding the development of OrangeSlices.
    2. Quick Data Phase:
        - Before automatic data fetching is set up, manually download match results from the GKSSA "Schedule" tab.
        - Calculate team statistics, such as All-Time Wins, Losses Per Season, and ELO over time.
    3. Data Fetching Phase:
        - With hundreds of games per season, it is not viable to manually download match data.
        - Set up OrangeSlices to automatically fetch the following data:
            - All match results from every season after 2001, including even seemingly irrelevant information.
            - All team rosters from every season after 2001.
    4. Tough Data Phase:
        - With access to the "tough to access" data, individual statistics such as Career Goals should be calculable.
        - New functionality, like a League-wide Goal Scorer Leaderboard, will be possible.
    5. Glow Up Phase:
        - Pretty up the GUI and whatever is necessary to make the program more useable.
